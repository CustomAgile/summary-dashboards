#Threat Matrix

Stories not associated with a feature will show on the threat matrix if they meet the other criteria.

If a feature does not have an Actual Start Date, then it's age will be 0.

Feature A has accepted stories in the last iteration and defined stories in the next iteration, but no In-Progress stories in the current iteration and project scope.  Feature A
will be shown on the graph with 0% density.

If Feature A from above is flagged as a Risk, it will be shown on the graph as 100% density.
